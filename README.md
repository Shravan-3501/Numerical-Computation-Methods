# Numerical-Computation-Methods

1] Solutions to systems of linear equations have been found using methods like
the Gaussian Elimination, Gauss-Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel. 

2] Euler and Runge-Kutta methods have been used to solve Initial Value Problems 
and Boundary Value Problems of ODEs. 

3] Estimated defnite integrals of non-integrable functions using Gaussian 
Quadrature and composite Simpson's rule.
